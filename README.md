# Smartforms
Re-Usable Smartforms for Public Cloud
These forms are the common forms requested by almost every client and with this repository we can have it all in one place.
Do's and Dont's:
Do's:
To reuse it one can download the zip folder of required form and upload the same in their respective client.
Dont's:
Dont try to commit or override the changes to any form without any prior notice.
Once approved by module lead, one can follow the process to do the same.
Cleaner the Environment, Better the reusability!!
Happy Coding!!
